# Obsidian Zhongwen Reader Plugin
Zhongwen Reader is a lightweight hover dictionary plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) that makes it easy to read Chinese text and build your vocabulary, all from within your notes. Originally based on obsidian-sample-plugin by the Obsidian team.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** If cloning this repository, make sure the folder inside your .obsidian/plugins is .obsidian/plugins/zhongwen-reader and not .obsidian/plugins/obsidian-zhongwen-reader.

# ✨ Features
- 🔍 Hover lookup: When this plugin is enabled, instantly see simplified, traditional, pinyin, and definitions (from CC-CEDICT dictionary) in a tooltip popup when hovering over Chinese words in your markdown editor or preview mode.
- 💡 HSK Highlighting: Use the command palette to toggle document-wide color-coded highlighting of vocabulary words from any of the HSK exams
- 📥 Save vocab: Select "Save Hovered Word to Vocab List" in the command palette while hovering to save a word to your personal vocab list
- 🧠 Example sentence capture: If the setting is enabled, automatically saves the sentence where you found the word into your vocab list as an example sentence. If you find the same vocab entry within a different sentence/context, the command "Save Hovered Word to Vocab List" will add the sentence as an additional example to the existing vocab entry.
- 📋 Sidebar view: See a list of vocab words used in the current note and navigate to the word within the note with a click.
- 🗃️ Spaced repetitions deck generation: Generate flashcards for the obsidian spaced repetitions plugin from your vocab list.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** As of now, the example sentences are saved into vocab.json but are not used in flashcard generation or shown in the plugin sidebar. Upcoming features will make use of them.
